### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>

This project was my very first submission for my coding boot camp.  I learned a good deal, including how to properly utilize html semantic elements, how to work with git and github and github pages, and how to write readme files.  I hit a few snags; the biggest was a case sentitivity issue where my relative paths had "assets" but VSCode kept automatically capitalizing the initial letter in the directory "Assets", causing my CSS and image files to fail to load.  I resolved this by changing "assets" to "Assets" in each instance.  I met with my tutor for the first time during the course of this project, and her help both confirmed the work that I had done and pointed me in the right direction in a couple areas.
